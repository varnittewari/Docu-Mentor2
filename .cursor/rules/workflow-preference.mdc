# Coding workflow preferences
-   Focus on the areas of code relevant to the task
-   Do not touch code that is unrelated to the task
-   Write thorough tests for all major functionality
-   Avoid making major changes to the patterns and architecture of how a feature works, after it has shown to work well, unless explicitly instructed
-   Always think about what other methods and areas of code might be affected by code changes
- Every function should do one thing and do it well. Its name should reflect that single purpose.
- Frontend validation is for user experience. Backend validation is for security and data integrity. The backend must never trust data coming from the client. It must re-validate everything.
- Do not use unnamed, hard-coded values directly in your logic. Assign them to clearly named constants at the top of the file or in a configuration file.
